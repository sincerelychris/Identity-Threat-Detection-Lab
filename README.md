# Identity Threat Detection Lab

## 🎯 Objective
Simulate identity-based attacks in a Microsoft Entra tenant, detect them using sign-in and audit logs, investigate activity, and implement security controls to reduce risk.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Microsoft Entra ID
- Sign-in Logs & Audit Logs
- Conditional Access
- Microsoft 365 Developer Tenant
- GitHub (documentation)

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Log analysis  
- Threat detection  
- Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)  
- Incident response  
- Root cause analysis  
- Conditional Access hardening  
- Security documentation  

## 🧪 What I Did (High Level)
- Simulated multiple failed authentication attempts  
- Detected anomalous sign-in behavior  
- Extracted IOCs from logs  
- Wrote a formal incident report  
- Implemented Conditional Access remediation  

## 🗂️ Project Structure
- `/evidence` → Screenshots and exported logs  
- `/incident-reports` → Formal investigation documentation  
- `/runbooks` → Repeatable investigation procedures  
- `/configs` → Notes on security controls implemented  
- `/architecture` → Lab design

## 📈 Outcome
Improved identity security posture by enforcing MFA and access controls, reducing exposure to risky authentication patterns.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add Sentinel integration  
- Automate alerting  
- Expand attack simulations
