# Identity Threat Detection Lab

## 🎯 Objective
Simulate identity-based attacks in a Microsoft Entra tenant, detect suspicious activity using authentication telemetry, investigate indicators of compromise, and apply remediation using Conditional Access controls.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Microsoft Entra ID  
- Sign-in Logs & Audit Logs  
- Conditional Access  
- Microsoft 365 Tenant  
- GitHub for documentation  

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Log analysis  
- Threat detection  
- Identity telemetry  
- Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)  
- Incident response  
- Root cause analysis  
- Conditional Access hardening  
- Security documentation  

## 🧪 What I Did
- Created controlled test users in Microsoft Entra  
- Simulated suspicious authentication behavior using repeated failed logins  
- Detected anomalies using Sign-in Logs  
- Extracted IOCs (IP, timestamps, client apps, failure patterns)  
- Produced a formal incident and root cause analysis report  
- Implemented Conditional Access policy to strengthen authentication security  

## 📂 Project Structure
- `/evidence` → Screenshots of logs, events, policies  
- `/incident-reports` → Formal SOC-style documentation  
- `/runbooks` → Investigation procedures  
- `/configs` → Notes on security controls  
- `/architecture` → Lab design

## 📈 Outcome
Improved identity security posture by enforcing stronger authentication controls and reducing exposure to risky sign-in behavior.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Integrate Microsoft Sentinel  
- Automate alerting  
- Expand to phishing simulations
